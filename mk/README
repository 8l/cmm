This directory contains a Unix version of the build utility `mk'.


Installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1) Edit the Makefile to choose suitable values for AR and RANLIB
     on your system

  2) Type `make'; you should eventually get a mk binary.

  3) Install the mk binary and the mk.1 man page in the locations of
     your choice.

  This distribution is intended to build on any POSIX system, but it
  has not been tested except on Linux.  If you have trouble building
  it on another POSIX system please write to Norman Ramsey
  <nr@eecs.harvard.edu>. 

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  In addition to the man page mk.1, you may find mk.pdf useful.


Licensing
~~~~~~~~~
  This software may be considered an adaptation under the Vita Nuova
  license (see LICENCE).  Everyone hereby has a non-exclusive
  sub-license to this code as explained in Appendix B of the LICENCE
  file from Vita Nuova (q.v.).  You are free to do anything you like

  This is a modified version of the mk software, not the original
  distribution from Vita Nuova.

  This software is distributed as is, with no warranty.  If it does
  anything useful, we're both surprised.

History
~~~~~~~
  mk was originally written by Andrew Hume as an improved version of Make
  mk was ported to Plan 9
  Plan 9 led to Inferno
  Vita Nuova (www.vitanuova.com) released a Unix version of Inferno under
    an open-source license
  Norman Ramsey <nr@eecs.harvard.edu> stripped down the Vita Nuova distribution
    to build mk as a standalone tool.
