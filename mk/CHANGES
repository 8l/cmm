        * Renamed strdup() to strdup9() to avoid name clash with
        function in libc on some systems. Bumped up version number in
        the Makefile. Updated this CHANGES by using cvs2cl(1).

	Changelog entry for NR's change.

	* include/lib9.h, lib/9/dirstat-Nt.c, lib/9/dirstat-posix.c,
	lib/9/dirstat.c: 
	
	Removed uid and gid fields from structure representing a directory.
	 mk does not use these fields, but they are present by default in
	lib9.  The advantage is we get to eliminate calls to getpwuid and
	getpwgid, which in turn means we don't have to open a connection to
	a YP (NIS) server.   With this change, mk in a small directory that
	needs no change runs twice as fast, and on those occasions when the
	YP server is overburdened, may save a factor of twenty on average
	(since mk no longer freezes for seconds waiting for the YP server).

	control, copyright, dirs, docs, files, mk.doc-base,
	mk.postinst.debhelper, mk.prerm.debhelper, mk.substvars, rules:
	Added debian/ which contains files necessary to build a Debian .deb
	package for mk. I've tested package building on
	lakeland.eecs.harvard.edu whose package-building tools are slighty
	out of date.
