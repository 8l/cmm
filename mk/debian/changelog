mk (20040305-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
  Removed uid and gid fields from structure representing a directory.
  mk does not use these fields, but they are present by default in lib9.
  The advantage is we get to eliminate calls to getpwuid and getpwgid,
  which in turn means we don't have to open a connection to a YP (NIS)
  server.   With this change, mk in a small directory that needs no
  change runs twice as fast, and on those occasions when the YP server
  is overburdened, may save a factor of twenty on average (since mk no
  longer freezes for seconds waiting for the YP server).
