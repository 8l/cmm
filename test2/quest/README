The short version: run "mk all" to run tests in this directory.

This directory contains tests for calling conventions. Each tests
consists of two files: one is compiled by a C compiler, the other by
qc--, and both are finally linked into one executable. When the
executable is run, it passes simple and complex values (structs) from
a function compiled by qc-- to a function compiled by the C compiler,
and vice versa. The tests checks, that the values are passed correctly.

The test cases are generated randomly with Quest, which emits two C
files. The number 0 indicates the complexity of the tests. Each file 
contains 5 test cases.

    test-0-main.c   test-0-callee.c

Both are compiled to C-- using LCC:

    test-0-main.c-- test-0-callee.c--

Since LCC and Quest may not be available, the pre-compiled sources files
are part of the CVS repository.

Now the main module may be compiled by qc-- and the callee by a C
compiler, and vice versa. This results in two executables which may be
run.

    test-0-cmm-gcc  test-0-gcc-cmm

In the first file the main module was compiled by a C compiler, in the
socond file it was compiled with qc-- and the callee module was compiled with the C compiler.

A passing test produces no output and exists with exit code 0. A failing
run either crashes, or produces some output on stderr that includes line
numbers that point towards the problem.

To run the tests, do "mk all"
