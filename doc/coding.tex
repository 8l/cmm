Coding conventions:

  88 columns

  emacs formatting OK

  default indent of 2 or 4

  use Caml capitalization not SML Standard Basis caps.
  This means `Constructors' and `mixed_words', not `CONSTRUCTORS' or `mixedWords'

  `in' on previous line

  try to avoid redundant parens, except in imperative code where they
  are essential.

  macqueen-style tuples, records, lists

  blank lines in code can be valuable, but avoid blank lines around
  noweb chunks---the noweb markup should be sufficient to delimit
  chunks, and the screen real-estate is precious.

  Use | as a prefix (not a separator) in matches and datatype definitions

Mkfile conventions:

  recipes to be preceded by a single tab, which makes for reasonable
  editing while producing readable output
