                 programming language that bridges the gap between C and
                 shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for
                 ``throw-away programming'' and rapid prototyping. Its
                 syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a
                 variety of other languages; most prominent are
                 influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. $<$BR$>$ The
                 Python interpreter is easily extended with new
                 functions and data types implemented in C. Python is
                 also suitable as an extension language for highly
                 customizable C applications such as editors or window
                 managers. $<$BR$>$ Python is available for various
                 operating systems, amongst which several flavors of
                 UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S.,
                 MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. $<$BR$>$
                 This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core
                 semantics'' of the language. It is terse, but attempts
                 to be exact and complete. The semantics of
                 non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in
                 functions and modules are described in the
                 $<$i$>$Python Library Reference$<$/i$>$. For an
                 informal introduction to the language, see the

  abstract =     "For a compiler writer, generating good machine code
                 for a variety of platforms is hard work. One might try
                 to reuse a retargetable code generator, but code
                 generators are complex and difficult to use, and they
                 limit one's choice of implementation language. One
                 might try to use C as a portable assembly language, but
                 C limits the compiler writer's flexibility and the
                 performance of the resulting code. The wide use of C,
                 despite these drawbacks, argues for a portable assembly
                 language. C{-}{-} is a new language designed expressly
                 for this purpose. The use of a portable assembly
                 language introduces new problems in the support of such
                 high-level run-time services as garbage collection,
                 exception handling, concurrency, profiling, and
                 debugging. We address these problems by combining the
                 C{-}{-} language with a C{-}{-} run-time interface. The
                 combination is designed to allow the compiler writer a
                 choice of source-language semantics and implementation
                 techniques, while still providing good performance.",
