Things that are not portable:

  * Code to set, query, and use floating-point rounding mode

  * The 'install' command. Instead,
      - Depend on the appropriate $install_ variable(s)
      - Include config/install.mk (which you might want to understand)
      - Use cp

  * The [ ... ] builtin shell command when using -n or -nt options
      - Use $config_test instead; we haven't been bitten yet

  * pod2html
      - Use nroff with -man macros instead (man 7 man)
