                            OCamlError

This directory contains the source code for OCamlError, a tool for stack
traces generated by programs compiled with the Objective Caml
(http://www.ocaml.org) byte code compiler. When such a program raises an
uncaught exception, it can emit a stack trace for debugging. Source code
positions in the stack trace are hard to understand, because they are
given in character offsets from the beginning of the file. They also
ignore #line directives in the source code that point to files the
source file was generated from. OCamlError reads such a stack trace and
annotates it with more readable source code locations:

       Called from module Set, character 8360
       Called from module Cfg3, character 31510 (cfg3.nw: 785, column 40)
       Called from module Astasm, character 4745 (astasm.nw: 238, column 39)
       
For a detailed description of OCamlError, see the manual page
ocamlerror.1 and ocamlerror-man.html.


Compiling from Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCamlError is implemented in Objective Caml as a literate program in
Noweb syntax. As such, source code and documentation are kept in one
file (*.nw). To extract the Objective Caml source code from the noweb
source files, we provide a Perl skript "nofake". This all happens under
control of a Makefile, so there is no need to worry about this. The
documentation for all modules is pre-processed and comes in HTML
format.

To compile, you need in your $PATH:

    Objective Caml 3.02 or better
    GNU Make
    Perl                            (for nofake)

Check the Makefile and type `make'.    

Copying

OCamlError is released into the public domain.
