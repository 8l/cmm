                          README for Lua-ML

Lua-ML is implementation of Lua version 2.5 in Objective Caml.  
Lua (http://www.lua.org) is an extension language designed to be
embedded into an application.  In Quick C--, Lua controls the
compiler's back end, which a programmer can customize by writing Lua
code. The Lua implementation relies on the build infrastructure from
the rest of the compiler, which nonstandard tools like mk and Noweb.
The Makefile.alone file helps you build the Lua interpreter from
source using standard tools.

PREREQUISITES

Lua-ML is written in Objective Caml. You need the following tools to
build it.

(1) Objective Caml 3.0[46]
(2) Perl
(3) GNU Make
(4) Standard Unix tools: sed    (probably forgot some here)


BUILDING THE INTERPRETER

(1) Get a lua-ml tar file from http://www.cminusminus.org/dist.

(2) Unpack the tar file and cd into the lua-ml directory.

	tar xf lua-ml.tar
        cd lua-ml
        
(3) Check the head of Makefile.alone but usually the default settings
    should just work.

(4)     make -f Makefile.alone depend
        make -f Makefile.alone all

    This builds the interpreter and demo clients.
    
(5) Read luaclient.html. This documents explains how to embed the
    interpreter into an application. Play with the luaclient binary and
    take a look at the luaclient target in Makefile.alone.

(6) The definition of Lua 2.5 is part of the directory: refman.ps.
    Not all of the library is implemented yet in Lua-ML.

(7) If you want to use the interpreter in your own applications you need
    to copy the following files to some place where ocamlc(1) can find
    them:

    lua-std.cma 
    lua*.cmi

CAVEATS

We normally build Lua-ML as an integrated part of the Quick C--
compiler, so we might accidentally introduce a bug into the standalone
build.   

All sources are literate programs, but to build the documentation 
you need the Quick C-- build infrastructure.

COPYRIGHT

The code, like the rest of Quick C--, is in the public domain.

CONTACT

The Lua implementation is by Norman Ramsey <nr@eecs.harvard.edu>, the
standalone patch by Christian Lindig <lindig@eecs.harvard.edu>. See
also http://www.cminusminus.org.

If you make changes to the interpreter or to the demo client
(luaclient.nw) *please* edit the *.nw files and *not* the derived files
*.ml and *.mli. Only send patches for *.nw files!
