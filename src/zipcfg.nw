\section{Applicative Control-Flow Graph, Based on Huet's Zipper}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 


\citet{huet:zipper} describes a generalization of a tree that enables
a program to focus on a single node while enabling the context (e.g.,
parents) to be represented by an explicit, reified value (as opposed
to being captured in an implicit continuation).
We investigate this idea for a control-flow graph.

Every graph has a single entry and zero or more exits.
(For example, the graph for a procedure has no exits, the graph
for an expanded instruction has one exit, and the graph for an
expanded conditional branch has two exits.)
A~[[graph]] is a set of basic blocks, one of which is distinguished as the
entry block.
Every other block is tagged by a
unique id, which may correspond to a string label.\footnote
{Maintaining a mapping between strings and unique ids is not the
  responsibility of this module.}

An exit is typically represented by explicit control flow to a unique id,
which corresponds to a block in another graph.
Exits also include special nodes that stop control flow, such as a
``return'' node or a ``forbidden'' node.
Finally, a graph may have at most one ``default exit,'' by which
control flows out of the graph when not otherwise directed.
A~default exit is useful only in a subgraph; because control may not
fall off the end of a {\PAL} procedure, the graph for an entire
procedure should not have a default exit.


A~[[zgraph]] is a graph with the \emph{focus} on one particular edge.
It supports at least the following kinds of operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Insert a new node at the focus, and maintain the focus on the current edge.
\end{itemize}
Here are some basic types and operations:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
type uid = Unique.uid
type label = uid * string

type regs  = Register.SetX.t  (* sets of regs for dataflow *)
type contedge = { kills:regs; defs:regs; node:label; assertion:Rtl.rtl }

module Rep : sig
  <<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>
  <<declarations of [[Rep]]'s public functions>>
end

type graph
type zgraph

val empty   : graph
val entry   : graph -> zgraph           (* focus on edge out of entry node *)
val exit    : graph -> zgraph           (* focus on edge into default exit node *)
val focus   : uid -> graph -> zgraph    (* focus on edge out of node with uid *)
val unfocus : zgraph -> graph           (* lose focus *)
@ 
%%  Subgraph replacement:
%%  we replace the node at the focus with a graph.
%%  The number of exits in the replacement graph must be equal to the
%%  number of successors of the focus node; otherwise it is a checked run-time
%%  error. 
%%  After replacement, the focus looks at the successor of the replacement
%%  graph's entry node.
%%  <zipcfg.mli>=
%%  val replace_focus : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
@ 
We can insert a single-entry, single-exit subgraph at
the current focus.
The new focus can be at either the entry edge or the exit edge.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val splice_focus_entry : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
val splice_focus_exit  : zgraph -> graph -> zgraph
@ 
Sometimes we just want to add blocks to an existing graph~[[g]].
We do it by creating a fresh graph~[[gz]]; the focus should be on the
edge leaving the entry node, which becomes unreachable.
The exit node of the new graph should also be unreachable.
The code is used in [[Ast2ir]] to add a continuation's prolog.

This is pretty ugly; it's a consequence of our being willing to insert
new nodes only following an entry node.  Maybe something less ugly is
lurking somewhere.  
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val add_blocks : graph -> zgraph -> graph
@ 
Building a graph.
The entry plays a dual role here; every constructor effectively
requires the focus be on the edge leaving the entry node and inserts a
new node at that edge.
After insertion, the focus remains on the edge leaving the entry node.

Here we also introduce the [[nodes]] type, which is equal to
[[zgraph -> zgraph]].
The idea is that we represent a sequence of nodes~$L$ by a function
that takes the successor~$S$ and produces the sequence~$LS$.
This representation is inspired by John Hughes's similar
representation of lists, which supports append in constant time.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val uid : unit -> uid
type exp_of_lbl = label -> Rtl.exp (* exp of code label *)
type 'a machine = 'a * 'a Mflow.machine * exp_of_lbl (* useful pairing *)
type nodes      = zgraph -> zgraph (* sequence of nodes in Hughes's representation *)
type cbranch    = ifso:label -> ifnot:label -> nodes (* ability to branch conditionally *)

val label        : 'a machine -> label -> nodes  (* spans? *)
val instruction  : Rtl.rtl -> nodes
val stack_adjust : Rtl.rtl -> nodes
val branch       : 'a machine -> label -> nodes
val jump         : 'a machine -> Rtl.exp -> uses:regs -> targets:string list -> nodes
val cbranch      : 'a machine -> Rtl.exp -> cbranch
val mbranch      : 'a machine -> Rtl.exp -> targets:label list -> nodes
val call         : 'a machine -> Rtl.exp -> altrets:contedge list -> 
                     unwinds_to:contedge list -> cuts_to:contedge list ->
                     aborts:bool -> uses:regs -> defs:regs -> kills:regs ->
                     reads:string list option -> writes:string list option ->
                     spans:Spans.t option -> succ_assn:Rtl.rtl -> nodes
val cut_to       : 'a machine -> Mflow.cut_args -> cuts_to:contedge list ->
                              aborts:bool -> uses:regs -> nodes
val return       : Rtl.rtl -> exit:int -> uses:regs -> nodes
val forbidden    : 'a machine -> nodes
  (* control should not reach; causes checked RTE *)
@ 
As a convenience, we provide code generation for if-then-else and while-do.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val if_then_else : 'a machine -> cbranch -> t:nodes -> f:nodes -> nodes
val while_do     : 'a machine -> cbranch -> body:nodes -> nodes
@ 
A limitcheck is a degenerate form of [[if]] with a special label.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val limitcheck : 'a machine -> cbranch -> t:nodes -> nodes
@ 
Sometimes we need to make the current focus (which must be the edge
leaving the entry)
a branch target to be used later.
Calling [[make_target gz]] returns a new graph and a unique identifier
to which the entry flows in.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val make_target : 'a machine -> zgraph -> label * zgraph
@ 
Mutation---ugh!
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val set_spans : zgraph -> Spans.t -> unit  (* set spans at node preceding focus *)
@ 
We can also make a graph out of a single [[middle]] or [[last]] node.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val single_middle : Rep.middle -> graph
val single_last   : Rep.last   -> graph
@ 
\subsubsection{Exposure}

A basic block is a [[first]] node, followed by zero or more [[middle]]
nodes, followed by a [[last]] node.
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type 'a edgelist = 'a list (* could be array *)
<<node types>>
type labelkind
  = Userlabel  (* user-written; cannot be deleted *)
  | Genlabel   (* generated; can be deleted *)
  | Limitlabel (* generated after limit check; cannot be deleted *)

type first
  = Entry
  | Label of label * labelkind * Spans.t option ref

type middle
  = Instruction  of Rtl.rtl
  | Stack_adjust of Rtl.rtl

type last
  = Exit
  | Branch  of Rtl.rtl * label
  | Cbranch of Rtl.rtl * label * label    (* true, false *)
  | Mbranch of Rtl.rtl * label edgelist (* possible successors *)
  | Call    of call  
  | Cut     of Rtl.rtl * contedge edgelist * regs  (* out edges, registers used *)
  | Return  of exit_num * Rtl.rtl * regs
  | Jump    of Rtl.rtl * regs * string list  (* inst, registers used, targets *)
  | Forbidden of Rtl.rtl (* cause a run-time error *)
and exit_num = int
@ In a complete graph for a procedure, the [[Exit]] node should not
appear, but it is useful in a subgraph (e.g., replacement for a node).
@
To sequence these things,
a~[[head]] is a [[first]] followed by zero or more [[middle]]s.
A~[[tail]] is  zero or more [[middle]]s followed by a [[last]].
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type head = First of first | Head of head * middle
type tail = Last  of last  | Tail of middle * tail
@
And now the zipper.  The focus is between the head and tail.
Notice we cannot ever focus on an inter-block edge.
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type zblock = head * tail
@
A block need not be in zipper form:
<<exposed types for [[Rep]] module>>=
type block = first * tail
@ 
We expose some utility functions:
<<declarations of [[Rep]]'s public functions>>=
val id  : block -> uid
val blocklabel : block -> label option (* entry block has no label *)
val blockkind  : block -> labelkind option (* entry block has no kind  *)
val fid : first -> uid
val entry_uid : uid

val zip   : zblock -> block
val unzip : block  -> zblock

val first      : zblock -> first
val last       : zblock -> last
val goto_start : zblock -> first * tail
val goto_end   : zblock -> head  * last
@ 
Some ways to combine parts:
<<declarations of [[Rep]]'s public functions>>=
val ht_to_first : head -> tail -> first * tail
val ht_to_last  : head -> tail -> head  * last
val zipht       : head -> tail -> block
@ 
We can splice a single-entry, single-exit graph onto a head or a tail.
For a head, we have a head~[[h]] followed by a graph~[[g]].
The entry node of~[[g]] gets joined to~[[h]], forming the entry into
the new graph.  The exit of~[[g]] becomes the new head.
For both arguments and results, the order of values is the order of
control flow: before splicing, the head flows into the graph; after
splicing, the graph flows into the head.
Splicing a tail is the dual operation.
(In order to maintain the order-means-control-flow convention, the
orders are reversed.)
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val splice_head : Rep.head -> graph -> graph * Rep.head
val splice_tail : graph -> Rep.tail -> Rep.tail * graph
@ 
We can also splice a single-entry, no-exit graph into a head.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val splice_head_only : Rep.head -> graph -> graph
@ 
Finally, we can find the entry node of a graph and remove it, leaving
a tail leading into the rest of the graph:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val remove_entry : graph -> Rep.tail * graph
@ 
Access to the representation:
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val to_blocks : graph -> Rep.block Unique.Map.t
val of_blocks : Rep.block Unique.Map.t -> graph  (* cheap *)
val of_block_list : Rep.block list -> graph  (* expensive *)
val openz : zgraph -> Rep.zblock * Rep.block Unique.Map.t
val tozgraph : Rep.zblock * Rep.block Unique.Map.t -> zgraph
@
Traversal: [[postorder_dfs]] returns a list of blocks reachable from
the entry node.
The postorder depth-first-search order means the list is in roughly
first-to-last order, as suitable for use in a forward dataflow problem.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val postorder_dfs : graph -> Rep.block list
@ 
For layout, we fold over pairs of type [[block * label option]] in
layout order.
The [[label]], if any, identifies the block that will be the layout
successor of the current block.
This may be useful to help an emitter omit the final [[goto]] of a
block that flows directly to its layout successor.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val fold_layout : (Rep.block -> label option -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a -> graph -> 'a
@ 
We can also fold and iterate over blocks.

@ 
\paragraph{Observing data flow}
As noted above a node can contribute defs, uses, and kills to each
outedge, and a non-join node may contribute uses to each inedge.
The access to this information is carefully crafted to support
liveness analysis and to provide for efficient implementation in the
common case where there is no dataflow.

The [[union_over_outedges]] function is written in continuation-passing
style.  The [[noflow]] continuation is used in the common case when an
edge bears no dataflow information; the [[flow]] continuation is used
in the general case.  Clients must guarantee that
[[noflow n = flow {node=n; defs=empty; kills=empty}]].
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val union_over_outedges :
  Rep.last -> noflow:(uid -> regs) -> flow:(contedge -> regs) -> regs
@ Function [[union_over_outedges]] is good for backward problems; the
corresponding function for forward problems is [[iter_outedges]].
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val iter_outedges :
  Rep.last -> noflow:(uid -> unit) -> flow:(contedge -> unit) -> unit
@
Calling [[add_inedge_uses n l]] returns the union of~[[l]] with any
uses on the inedge to~[[n]].
It is defined on \emph{all} nodes, because there are no uses on the
inedges of a join point.
In the common case, it returns its second argument.
Calling [[add_live_spans n l]] returns the union of~[[l]] with any
registers kept live in spans.
Spans keep register live if they may be needed to walk the stack.
<<zipcfg.mli>>=
val add_inedge_uses : Rep.last  -> regs -> regs
val add_live_spansl : Rep.last  -> regs -> regs
val add_live_spansf : Rep.first -> regs -> regs
@ 

\paragraph{Conversion from a DAG}
Parts of the compiler work with DAG's for convenience, but eventually we need to
  convert the DAGs to CFGs.

\paragraph{Splicing support}

We want to be able to scrutinize a single-entry, single-exit graph for
splicing purposes. 
There are two useful cases: the graph is a single block or it isn't.
We use continuation-passing style.

\paragraph{DAG conversion}

The following functions convert DAGs to graph fragments.
The conversion functions also return a boolean value that indicates whether
  the graph is modified during the conversion.

There's probably a better way to do this:
  I'm polluting the namespace and exposing my mutable variable...
  hence, this code is not re-entrant.
Free reference [[modified]] is set only if a new node is added to the graph.
IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO REASSOCIATE TO AVOID REPLACING INSTRUCTION $i$
WITH $i; \mathtt{Nop}$. 
<<zipcfg.ml>>=
let modified = ref false
<<mutually recursive graph construction>>=

N.B. the sharing works only for a DAG---the graph must be acyclic.
