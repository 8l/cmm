\section{Automaton-Based Slot Allocation}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------ 

\emph{The predicates for [[choice]] and [[first_choice]] take [[width]]
and [[kind]] in different orders. Maybe we should define an extra type
alias. --CL}

This module supports Bailey-Davidson automata for allocating locations
for value-passing.
An automaton manages a set of hardware locations, which it uses to
satisfy allocation requests.
In the Bailey-Davidson framework, the set of locations is split into
two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item
A finite set of locations, which may be managed arbitrarily
\item
An infinite set of locations, which must be allocated sequentially and
contiguously
\end{itemize}
We call the infinite set of locations the \emph{overflow block}.
@
The overflow block has a number of properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The overflow block has a \emph{maximum alignment}.
This alignment is the maximum possible alignment of any location in
the block, and it is a function of the calling convention.
\item
The overflow block has a \emph{direction of growth}.
\item
The overflow block has a \emph{number of bytes allocated}.
\end{itemize}
The maximum alignment and direction of growth are fixed when the
overflow block is created; the number of bytes allocated increases
monotonically during allocation.
@
The Bailey-Davidson automaton has two parts: a finite-state control
that manages the finite set of locations, and an infinite-state
control for the overflow block.
The infinite set of states is mapped to a finite set by considering
only the number of bytes allocated modulo the maximum alignment.
We use a value of type [[Memalloc.t]] to manage this part of the
automaton.
@
The interface exports abstract types, concrete types, and values.

\subsection{Standard kinds}

We might use these kinds:\\
\begin{tabular}{>{\ttfamily}ll}
signed& Signed integer\\
unsigned& Unsigned integer\\
address&  Address\\
float&    Floating-point value\\
\end{tabular}\\
A missing or empty kind is assumed to be [[unsigned]].
@
\subsection{Observer-Mutator interface}
An [[Automaton.t]] encapsulates mutable state.  
Allocating a location mutates its state.
After allocation is completed, an automaton is \emph{frozen},
and it can no longer be mutated.
A~frozen automaton gives us an overflow block, its state, and the set
of locations handed out.
The set implicitly includes every location in the overflow block; the
rest of the set is explicit.
<<abstract types>>=
type t
<<exposed types>>=
type result =
  { overflow    : Block.t
  ; regs_used   : Register.Set.t
  ; mems_used   : Rtl.loc list
  ; align_state : int   (* final alignment state of overflow block *)
  }
@ 
We allocate a location by identifying a value's type, which in {\PAL}
is a width and a kind.
<<exported values>>=
val allocate : t -> width:int -> kind:string -> align:int -> loc
val freeze   : t -> result
@
In some conventions, a value must be split between two registers or
between registers and memory.
Accordingly, we need a special type of location: an object with fetch
and store methods.
<<exposed types>>=
type width = int
type kind  = string
type loc = Rtlutil.aloc =
    { fetch  : width -> Rtl.exp
    ; store  : Rtl.exp -> width -> Rtl.rtl
    }
<<exported values>>=
val fetch  : loc ->            width -> Rtl.exp
val store  : loc -> Rtl.exp -> width -> Rtl.rtl
@ 
Most locations are easy.
<<exported values>>=
val of_loc : Rtl.loc -> loc
@ 
\subsection{Constructor interface}
Most clients will simply use an automaton, but some will need to
create one.
For these a representation with two functions: an allocator, and
something that implements [[freeze]].
The allocator takes an additional alignment, which it uses if it has
to put the value in memory.
If called directly from [[val allocate]], the alignment is always~$1$,
but it may be changed by upstream implementations.
The [[freeze]] function accumulates information about locations handed
out, which information it passes to the right. 
At the very end is the overflow block.
<<exposed types>>=
type methods =
    { allocate : width: int -> alignment: int -> kind: string -> loc
    ; freeze   : Register.Set.t -> Rtl.loc list -> result
    } 
@ To get an instance of an automaton, we need to provide a memory
space and a start address for the overflow block.
(I'M CONCERNED THAT WE USE A START ADDRESS HERE BUT TYPICALLY USE A
BASE ADDRESS ELSEWHERE.  THIS DIFFERENCE MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THINGS
THAT GROW DOWN.) 
<<exported values>>=
val at         : Rtl.space -> start:Rtl.exp -> stage -> t
val of_methods : methods -> t
@ 
The idea is that we build an implementation by a composition of
stages.
We provide stages that change alignment, adjust widths, hand out
locations, and so on.
In addition, we expect that a client might write its own stages.
<<abstract types>>=
type stage
<<exported values>>=
val ( *> ) : stage -> stage -> stage
@ 
Because it's a nuisance to manage the threading of the [[start]]
parameter through the stages, we provide a function that lets clients
build their own stages.
<<exported values>>=
val wrap   : (methods -> methods) -> stage
@ 
\paragraph{The overflow block, if any}
The final stage in any implementation is the overflow block.
To make an overflow block, you need a bunch of information about the
machine and a bunch of information about the convention.
<<exported values>>=
val overflow : growth:Memalloc.growth -> max_alignment:int -> stage
@ 
It is possible to have {no} overflow block.
In this case, it's up to clients to gather that only finitely many
requests are made and that the automaton satisfies all of them.
Such an automaton is useful for conventions in which only finitely 
many values can be passed,  such as the C~return
convention.
@ 
\paragraph{Selection and adjustment of width}
The [[widths]] stage can restrict the convention to satisfy only
requests naming a listed width.
<<exported values>>=
val widths : int list -> stage
@
The [[widen f]] stage  alters a request for a
width~[[w]] so it has a width [[f w]], which must be at least as large as~[[w]].
The widening operation depends on the kind.
For a little-endian machine passing values in memory, widening an
unsigned integer or address is
equivalent to adding padding.
For a big-endian machine, it isn't.
It is an unchecked run-time error for [[f]] to return a result that is
less than its argument.
<<exported values>>=
val widen  : (int -> int) -> stage
@ We expect stages such as
[[Automaton.widen (Auxfuns.round_up_to ~multiple_of:32)]] 
to be useful.
@
\paragraph{Adjustment of alignment}
If a value must be allocated in memory, it needs an alignment.
All alignments start out at~1, but we can provide a function that
maps a width to an alignment.
Danger Will Robinson!
The argument to the function is a width in \emph{bits}, but the
alignment is a size in \emph{bytes} (actually the unit is not the byte
but the cell size of target memory).
<<exported values>>=
val align_to : (int -> int) -> stage
@ 
\paragraph{Allocation of registers}
Although it may not be terribly useful, we provide a simple stage that
hands out registers sequentially.
To satisfy a request, the stage takes the first~$n$ registers, where
$n$~is chosen such that the number of bits in these registers is
exactly the number of bits in the request.
If there is no such~$n$, it barfs with an error message.
<<exported values>>=
val useregs : Register.t list -> bool -> stage
@ The [[useregs]] stage is stateful; a register handed out in response
to an earlier request cannot be used to satisfy a later request.
@
See the paper for these.
(The boolean value that [[regs_by_bits]] and [[regs_by_args]]
expect to receive indicates whether you would like normal semantics
or "reserve" semantics: allocate a register if available, pass
request on to successive stages, throw away any allocations they
make, and return the register.  [[false]] indicates normal semantics
and [[true]] turns on reserve semantics.)
<<abstract types>>=
type counter = string
type counterenv
<<exported values>>=
val bitcounter  : counter -> stage
val regs_by_bits: counter -> Register.t list -> bool -> stage

val argcounter  : counter -> stage
val regs_by_args: counter -> Register.t list -> bool -> stage

val pad         : counter -> stage
@ 
And this is documented nowhere, not even in the paper.  It is used
to post-process the results from a [[freeze]] request.  For example,
\module{mipscall.nw} uses [[postprocess]] to require that the overflow
block is padded with an extra 16-byte block.
<<exported values>>=
val postprocess : stage -> (result -> result) -> stage
@
\paragraph{Combination of multiple stages}
It can be useful to hand out different registers from different piles.
For example, we might want to use floating-point registers to satisfy
[["float"]] requests and integer registers to satisfy other requests.
The following combinator makes it possible to use different stages for
different requests.
Because the stages don't communicate, it is probably not too useful
for describing C~conventions (C~varargs hell), but it should be useful
for {\PAL} conventions.

The idea is that for an allocation, we use the first stage for which
the predicate is satisfied.
It is a checked run-time error if no predicate is satisfied.
<<exposed types>>=
type choice_predicate = int -> string -> counterenv -> bool
<<exported values>>=
val choice : (choice_predicate * stage) list -> stage
@ To help create predicates we provide several convenience functions.
<<exported values>>=
val counter_is : counter -> (int -> bool) -> choice_predicate
val is_kind    : kind                     -> choice_predicate
val is_width   : int                      -> choice_predicate
val is_any     :                             choice_predicate
@ 
\paragraph{Using an automaton as a stage}

Although it is not necessary for calling conventions, we have found it
convenient to abuse the abstraction by using an automaton [[inner]] as
a stage in an [[outer]] automaton.
The idea is to use [[as_stage inner]] as a stage.
When this stage receives an allocation request, it passes the request
to the [[inner]] automaton.  
Thus [[as_stage inner]] behaves like an overflow block: it is the
final stage in its automaton, and it has no successor.
But when the [[outer]] automaton is frozen, it has no effect on the
[[inner]] automaton, which can continue to satisfy allocation
requests.
<<exported values>>=
val as_stage : t -> stage
@
\paragraph{Other forms of history}

Most calling conventions keep track of little history beyond knowing
what locations have been used.
The MIPS convention is unusual in that the placement a second
parameter, if of floating-point type, may be placed in one of two
different available locations depending on the type of the first
parameter. 
My solution is to enable an automaton to ``become'' another on the
basis of the first allocation request.
Because these things can be chained, I~believe the solution may be
general.

The first time an allocation reaches this stage, we select the
first alternative satisfying the predicate.
Thereafter \emph{the whole automaton behaves as this alternative}.
If no choice is ever made, the automaton freezes as the first
alternative.
It is a checked run-time error if no predicate is satisfied.
<<exported values>>=
val first_choice : (choice_predicate * stage) list -> stage
@ 

QUESTION FOR MARK BAILEY: HAS HE CAREFULLY ANALYZED WHAT CLASS OF
AUTOMATA CAN BE SPECIFIED IN CCL?

\paragraph{The unit stage}
The [[unit]] stage does nothing, passing on an allocation
or freeze request straight to the stages that follow it in the pipeline.
It may be useful either as a default stage within a [[choice]] stage
(along with the [[is_any]] primitive) to make sure we don't fall off
the end of the [[choice]], or with [[List.fold_right]] in OCaml to compose a
list of stages into one stage (using the [[*>]] operator).

<<exported values>>=
val unit : stage
@
\paragraph{Debugging}
<<exported values>>=
val debug : counter -> (int -> string -> int -> int -> unit) -> stage
@ 
\paragraph{Lua Registration of Calling Conventions}
Ideally it would be nice for these types to sit in some other module
(maybe \module{call.nw}?) but there are some dependency issues that force
it to be in here for now.
<<registration types>>=
type cc_spec  = { call : stage; results : stage; cutto : stage }
type cc_specs = (string * cc_spec) list
@
<<exported values>>=
val init_cc : cc_specs
@ 
\section{Implementation}

Those internal types not fully defined in the interface:
<<hidden types>>=
type counter    = string
type counterenv = string -> int ref option
<<hidden types that refer to [[methods]]>>=
type t = methods
type implementation = I of (start:Rtl.exp -> space:Rtl.space -> ctrs:counterenv -> t)
type stage = S of (implementation -> implementation)
@ 

During a debugging session I reviewed the [[Exclude]] submodule and
believe it is correct. However, I did not review the handling of
[[cellcount]]. --CL

<<automaton.ml>>=
<<hidden types>>
<<exposed types>>
<<hidden types that refer to [[methods]]>>

module R   = Rtl
module RS  = Register.Set
module B   = Block
module M   = Memalloc
let impossf fmt = Printf.kprintf Impossible.impossible fmt
let unimp  = Impossible.unimp
@ 
The big idea here is hooking up the end of the pipeline:
<<automaton.ml>>=
let ( *> ) (S f1) (S f2) = S (fun rhs -> f1 (f2 rhs))

let pipeline_end = I (
  fun ~start ~space ~ctrs -> 
    let block = Block.at ~base:start ~size:0 ~alignment:1 in
    { allocate = (fun ~width ~alignment ~kind -> impossf
                  "fell off end of pipeline -- multiple return values from C?")
    ; freeze   =
      (fun regs mems -> 
       {overflow = block; regs_used = regs; mems_used = mems; align_state = 0})
    })
@
All the work of the implementation is in the closures.
<<automaton.ml>>=
let at space ~start (S s) =
  let I f = s pipeline_end in
    f ~start ~space ~ctrs:(fun _ -> None)

let of_methods t                     = t
let allocate   t ~width ~kind ~align = t.allocate width align kind
let freeze     t                     = t.freeze Register.Set.empty []

let fetch  loc = loc.fetch
let store  loc = loc.store
let of_loc loc = { fetch  = R.fetch loc; store = R.store loc }
@ 
\subsection{Wrapping etc.}

There's substantial bookkeeping in passing the start address around.
We prefer to program in terms of [[methods]] rather than
implementation.

let swrap f =
  S (fun (I next) -> I (fun ~start ~space ~ctrs ->

                 choices
   in f choices (next ~start ~space ~ctrs) ~ctrs))
@
The overflow block is slightly interesting.
<<automaton.ml>>=
type state = { mutable mem       : M.t; mutable frozen : bool
             ; mutable mems_list : R.loc list  }
let overflow ~growth ~max_alignment next =
  fun ~start ~space:((_, byteorder, memsize) as space) ~ctrs ->
    let mem = M.at start growth in
    let state = { mem = mem; frozen = false; mems_list = [] } in
    <<functions [[allocate]] and [[freeze]] for the overflow block>>
    { allocate = allocate; freeze = freeze }
let overflow ~growth ~max_alignment = 
  swrap (overflow ~growth ~max_alignment) 
@ 
To allocate, we align and increment the memory block.
The address of the new location depends on the direction of stack growth.
<<functions [[allocate]] and [[freeze]] for the overflow block>>=
let allocate ~width ~alignment ~kind =
  if not (Cell.divides memsize width) then
   impossf "width %d not multiple of memsize %d" width (Cell.size memsize);
  if max_alignment mod alignment <> 0 then
   impossf "max alignment %d not multiple of alignment %d" max_alignment alignment;
  if state.frozen then impossf "Allocation from a frozen overflow block";
  let (R.C c) as count = Cell.to_count memsize width in
  let mem  = state.mem in
  let mem  = M.align mem alignment in
  let mem' = M.allocate mem c in
  let addr = M.current (match growth with M.Up -> mem | M.Down -> mem') in
  let loc  = (R.mem (R.aligned alignment) space count addr) in
  state.mems_list <- loc :: state.mems_list;
  state.mem <- mem';
  of_loc loc in
@ 
To freeze, we have to adjust the block alignment if the stack grows down.
We might not want to be appending lists, but we do so now for simplicity.
<<functions [[allocate]] and [[freeze]] for the overflow block>>=
let freeze regs mems =
  state.frozen <- true;
  let mem    = state.mem in

\paragraph{Choice and First Choice Stages}
 
The dataflow here is kind of interesting.  
For the [[allocate]] method, we have a fan-out and fan-in, with a fork
and join point, so it passes through exactly \emph{one} choice.
But for the [[freeze]] method, we thread the call straight through the
whole list, so it passes through \emph{all} choices.

combine multiple hardware resources into one abstract `location'.

\paragraph{Using an automaton as a stage}

To us an automaton as a stage, we pass on an allocation request but
ignore a freeze request.

    let freeze regs mems =
      { regs_used = regs; mems_used = mems;

    { allocate = inner.allocate; freeze = freeze }
let as_stage inner = swrap (as_stage inner)
